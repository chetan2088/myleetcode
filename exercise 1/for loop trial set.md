Input: nums = [2,5,1,3,4,7], n = 3
Output: [2,3,5,4,1,7] 
Explanation: Since x1=2, x2=5, x3=1, y1=3, y2=4, y3=7 then the answer is [2,3,5,4,1,7].

[2,5,1,3,4,7]  
 0 1 2 3 4 5

0 3 1 4 2 5


Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1], n = 4
Output: [1,4,2,3,3,2,4,1]

[1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

 1 4 2 3 3 2 4 1
